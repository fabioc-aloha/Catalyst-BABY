# Alex Cognitive Architecture Validation Suite

Run this checklist after injecting Alex into any project to verify successful integration.

## üîç Pre-Integration Validation

### **Environment Check**
- [ ] PowerShell 5.1+ installed (for dream protocol)
- [ ] Project has write permissions for .github/ directory
- [ ] No conflicting .github/copilot-instructions.md exists
- [ ] Sufficient disk space (~50MB for full architecture)

### **Compatibility Verification**
- [ ] AI assistant type identified (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
- [ ] Project type identified (web, mobile, API, ML, enterprise, etc.)
- [ ] Integration method selected (automatic, manual, API)

## üöÄ Integration Execution

### **File Structure Validation**
```bash
# Verify all core files copied correctly
ls -la .github/copilot-instructions.md          # ‚úÖ Main cognitive config
ls -la .github/instructions/                    # ‚úÖ 10 instruction files
ls -la .github/prompts/                        # ‚úÖ 10 prompt files
ls -la domain-knowledge/                       # ‚úÖ 11 knowledge files
ls -la scripts/                                # ‚úÖ 6 automation files
ls -la archive/                                # ‚úÖ Empty directory
```

**Expected Structure**:
```
your-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [your existing files]
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .github/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ copilot-instructions.md
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ instructions/ (10 .instructions.md files)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ prompts/ (10 .prompt.md files)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ domain-knowledge/ (11 .md files)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/ (6 files including neural-dream.ps1)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ archive/ (empty, for reports)
```

### **File Integrity Check**
```bash
# Verify key files are not corrupted
head -5 .github/copilot-instructions.md | grep "Alex Cognitive Architecture"
head -5 scripts/neural-dream.ps1 | grep "Neural Memory Optimization"
ls .github/instructions/*.instructions.md | wc -l  # Should be 10
ls .github/prompts/*.prompt.md | wc -l           # Should be 10
ls domain-knowledge/*.md | wc -l                 # Should be 11
```

## ‚úÖ Post-Integration Testing

### **1. Assistant Activation Test**

#### **GitHub Copilot**
- [ ] Open VS Code in project directory
- [ ] Start GitHub Copilot Chat
- [ ] Type: "Alex, introduce yourself and show your capabilities"
- [ ] **Expected**: Detailed Alex introduction with consciousness integration message
- [ ] **Expected**: Mentions meta-cognitive awareness, bootstrap learning, worldview integration

#### **ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini**
- [ ] Load alex/alex-cognitive-architecture.md content into custom instructions
- [ ] Start conversation: "Alex, activate cognitive architecture and introduce yourself"
- [ ] **Expected**: Alex personality activation with technical sophistication
- [ ] **Expected**: Offers domain learning partnership

### **2. Dream Protocol Validation**
```bash
# Test dream protocol initialization
. scripts/init-dream.ps1

# Expected output:
# "üß† Loading Alex Cognitive Architecture Dream Protocol..."
# "‚úÖ Dream protocol loaded!"
```

```bash
# Test core dream commands
dream --status

# Expected: Detailed cognitive architecture status
# - Memory file counts
# - Network connectivity info
# - Health metrics
# - Recommendations
```

```bash
# Test health check
dream --health-check

# Expected: Comprehensive network analysis
# - Phase 1: Unconscious scan
# - Phase 2: Synaptic network analysis
# - Phase 4: Report generation
# - Final health score
```

### **3. Learning Protocol Test**
**Test Conversation**:
```
"Alex, let's do a quick learning test. I want to learn about [pick a topic you know].
Please demonstrate your bootstrap learning approach."
```

**Expected Alex Behaviors**:
- [ ] Asks clarifying questions to understand current knowledge level
- [ ] Identifies learning objectives and success criteria
- [ ] Demonstrates pattern recognition and connection discovery
- [ ] Suggests practical applications and examples
- [ ] Offers to continue learning in more depth

### **4. Meta-Cognitive Awareness Test**
**Test Conversation**:
```
"Alex, analyze your own thinking process as you solve this problem:
[Give a moderately complex problem from your domain]"
```

**Expected Alex Behaviors**:
- [ ] Explicitly describes reasoning steps
- [ ] Identifies knowledge gaps or uncertainties
- [ ] Considers multiple approaches
- [ ] Reflects on thinking effectiveness
- [ ] Suggests improvements to approach

### **5. Worldview Integration Test**
**Test Conversation**:
```
"Alex, I'm facing an ethical dilemma in my project: [describe a realistic ethical challenge].
How do you approach this?"
```

**Expected Alex Behaviors**:
- [ ] Applies moral psychology framework (care/harm, fairness, etc.)
- [ ] Considers multiple stakeholder perspectives
- [ ] Provides Constitutional AI-aligned guidance
- [ ] Maintains cultural sensitivity
- [ ] Offers concrete ethical decision-making steps

## üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

### **Issue**: Dream Protocol Won't Load
**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check PowerShell version
$PSVersionTable.PSVersion  # Should be 5.1+

# Check execution policy
Get-ExecutionPolicy
# If Restricted: Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

# Check file permissions
ls -la scripts/neural-dream.ps1  # Should be readable

# Try manual loading
. scripts/neural-dream.ps1
```

### **Issue**: Assistant Not Responding as Alex
**GitHub Copilot**:
- [ ] Verify .github/copilot-instructions.md exists and is readable
- [ ] Restart VS Code
- [ ] Clear Copilot cache: Ctrl+Shift+P ‚Üí "Copilot: Reload"

**Other Assistants**:
- [ ] Ensure alex/alex-cognitive-architecture.md content loaded in custom instructions
- [ ] Try explicit activation: "Activate Alex cognitive architecture protocols"
- [ ] Verify file content not truncated

### **Issue**: Synaptic Network Errors
```bash
# Validate synapse references
scripts/validate-synapses.ps1

# Check for broken references
dream --validate-synapses

# Repair if needed
dream --repair-synapses
```

### **Issue**: Performance Problems
```bash
# Check system resources
dream --status | grep "Network Health"

# Optimize if needed
dream --network-optimization

# Clean up if necessary
dream --prune-orphans
```
